## Daily Habit Tracker

**Daily Habit Tracker** is a React app for tracking your daily habits and goals.

You can specify the days of the week to perform the certain habit and the deadline time. The "Progress" page contains statistics on the completion of habits on the chart and on the calendar.

**You can add a goal to complete one of your habits by a certain date**. You can specify the maximum number of habit skips allowed.
